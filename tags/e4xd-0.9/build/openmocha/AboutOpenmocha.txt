OpenMocha is an open source Javascript website application server 
and development framework. Quick soft-coding and clean hard-coding 
in Javascript on the client-side AND the server-side. 

The goal of OpenMocha is to maximize the fun and productivity of 
Javascript development by blending the gap between browser and server 
based scripting.

With OpenMocha, a new project can be quickly soft-coded by creating 
custom Mocha Objects using the web browser. As the project matures, 
these Mocha Objects can be re-factored and hard-coded in separate 
code files. The two approaches can be mixed at any time, patching 
hard-coded applications through soft-coding even during runtime.


*** Prerequisites and System Requirements 

To run OpenMocha a Java Virtual Machine 1.4 or better is required.

For FreeBSD and other operating systems with ports collection you may 
install a JRE or JDK from the ports collection. For Windows, Linux and 
Solaris you can get a Java runtime or development kit from 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/. If you are on Mac OS X then you 
already have a Java runtime that will work well with OpenMocha.

While you can integrate OpenMocha with other tools such as Apache 
and MySQL, you do not have to. OpenMocha is pre-configured to be 
deployed on its own and comes with a built-in object oriented 
database and web server. 


*** Getting started with OpenMocha

For FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and other Unix flavors, start 
the Helma framework by invoking ./start.sh from the command line. On 
Windows, invoke start.bat instead.

If the java command can not be found, make sure the JAVA_HOME 
environment variable is set to the location of your Java installation.

With Helma running, you should be able to connect using your 
browser and the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/ or http://localhost:8080/

To initialize the setup, complete the user registration form 
at http://127.0.0.1:8080/exampleapp/register and follow the 
instructions to copy the security information into the 
server.properties file. You may then login to your new OpenMocha 
server via http://127.0.0.1:8080/exampleapp/login and start 
configuring and deploying your web applications.
