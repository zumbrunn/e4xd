*** Running Openmocha with earlier Java versions

In order to run Openmocha on systems with a Java version older than 1.5, 
you need two additional jar files to make Rhino's E4X support work. 

You'll need to put those two files into the "ext" subdirectory inside 
the "lib" directory of your opnemocha install, like this: 

openmocha-0.8/lib/ext/xbean.jar 
openmocha-0.8/lib/ext/jsr173_1.0_api.jar 

After that, openmocha should start as intended. 


*** More info and help

Other than what you find on the (possibly not yet existing) e4xd.org 
website, the best places to get in touch are the openmocha mailing 
list and google group or the #helma@irc.freenode.net IRC channel. 

http://groups.google.com/group/openmocha
irc://irc.freenode.net/helma

Also, in case you are new to Helma, you of course need to add the 
helma.org website and mailing lists to the top of that list.

To get in touch with me directly, you should find additional contact 
information on the zumbrunn.com site.
