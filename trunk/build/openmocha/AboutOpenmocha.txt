This is the README file for OpenMocha 0.6

*** About OpenMocha

OpenMocha is an open source Javascript website application server 
and development framework. Quick soft-coding and clean hard-coding 
in Javascript on the client-side AND the server-side. 

The goal of OpenMocha is to maximize the fun and productivity of 
Javascript development by blending the gap between browser and server 
based scripting.

With OpenMocha, a new project can be quickly soft-coded by creating 
custom Mocha Objects using the web browser. As the project matures, 
these Mocha Objects can be re-factored and hard-coded in separate 
code files. The two approaches can be mixed at any time, patching 
hard-coded applications through soft-coding even during runtime.

OpenMocha intends to stretch and scale between fast all-in-one 
deployment and complex integration in best-of-breed environments. 

*** Prerequisites and System Requirements 

To run OpenMocha a Java Virtual Machine 1.4 is recommended.

For FreeBSD and other operating systems with ports collection you may 
install a JRE or JDK from the ports collection. For Windows, Linux and 
Solaris you can get a Java runtime or development kit from 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/. If you are on Mac OS X then you 
already have a Java runtime that will work well with OpenMocha.

While you can integrate OpenMocha with other tools such as Apache and
MySQL, you do not have to. OpenMocha is pre-configured to be deployed 
on its own and comes with a built-in object oriented database, a 
built-in web server and the James mail server. 


*** Getting started with OpenMocha

For FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and other Unix flavors, start 
OpenMocha by invoking ./start.sh from the command line. On Windows, 
invoke start.bat instead.

If the java command can not be found, make sure the JAVA_HOME 
environment variable is set to the location of your Java installation.

With OpenMocha running, you should be able to connect using your 
browser and the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/ or http://localhost:8080/

To initialize the setup, complete the user registration form at 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/register and follow the instructions to copy 
the security information into the server.properties file. You may 
then login to your new OpenMocha server via http://127.0.0.1:8080/login
and start configuring and deploying your web applications. 

In order to start exploring OpenMocha, add and edit some new pages via 
the web browser. On the edit page you will find a Settings button that 
will take you to the soft-coding environment. Play by creating some 
Mocha Objects and putting server-side Javascript in the top textareas 
and HTML markup and client-side Javascript in the bottom textareas.

To explore the hard-coding environment and begin to understand the way 
it relates to the soft-coding environment, take a look at the following 
files inside the apps/main/Mocha and apps/main/Page directories:

apps/main/Mocha/script.skin
apps/main/Mocha/style.skin
apps/main/Page/head.skin
apps/main/Page/pre.skin
apps/main/Page/main.skin
apps/main/Page/post.skin
apps/main/Page/helloworld.hac

Note that you can see the result of the helloworld example page action 
by accessing the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/helloworld or by attaching 
"helloworld" to the URL of any page that you create. 

Note that you will find the helloAgain example, a custom Mocha Object,  
inside the post.skin file and in the list of Mocha Objects on the 
settings page.

At the http://openmocha.org website, you'll find further information 
as well as the details about the newly setup mailing list where you 
are welcome to ask any questions.

See you at openmocha.org !
